# WiiMoteDSU

## Install

TODO: Add install notes (just using android studio at the moment)

## Dolphin

If you want to use this application with the Dolphin emulator, select other input devices and
fill in your phones IP address and port 26760. Moreover, a controller profile configuration file
can be found in this repository, which should work for most games  (some games using motion input
may be troublesome, although implemented).

## Credits

A lot of this application's code was made possible by looking at an existing DSU server
implementation for Joy Con controllers at https://github.com/joaorb64/joycond-cemuhook/tree/master

Also the specification of the DSU protocol at https://v1993.github.io/cemuhook-protocol/ is of
great value
